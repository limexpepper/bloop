### What is Toiletto?
Toiletto is a toilet review application. 

### Why was Toiletto created?
I believe commercial entities have a duty to uphold public hygiene standards given that it is a basic human right. From a business perspective, this is a fair demand that consumers should make. The hygiene and cleanliness of toilets located in commercial spaces are part of the consumer experience, which is why premium malls have been able to command their premium. This leads me to a consequential argument that poor toilet hygiene standards in non-premium commercial spaces seek to exacerbate inequality; that the have-nots have no ability to fork premiums like the haves do at premium malls.

### What can you do with Toiletto?
You can do either of two things:
(1) Check the ratings for toilets around Singapore (only commercial spaces such as malls, attractions and cafes for now)
(2) Rate your toilet visit experience 

### Where can I use Toiletto?
Toiletto can be accessed from a browser using any internet-connected device. This makes Toiletto a web application, and not a mobile application. The application has been optimised for viewing on most screens, from small screens such as iPhone/Samsung to mid-sized screens such as iPads and larger screens such as your desktop.

However. By the time youâ€™re reading this, it is no longer accessible from the internet. I have made the regrettable decision to no longer deploy Toiletto. 

The hosting provider that I currently use charges fees after usage of the app crosses a certain bandwidth level. I have tried to find alternatives such as deploying on the free AWS EC2 instance but I couldnâ€™t get it to work. I have also considered suggestions from friends to allow advertising placements on Toiletto, but that didnâ€™t sit right with me. I didnâ€™t want to compromise the UIUX and would abhor being known to have created a crummy-looking website. 

So until I can find a place to deploy Toiletto for free, I will be letting Toiletto sleep. I hope I would be able to revive it in future.

### My reflections on creating Toiletto
Toiletto is the first big thing i put out to the world. Years of learning how to code culminated in something as meaningful as Toiletto. It opened a world of possibilities for me as I can now turn any idea into reality. It was and still is an empowering moment.

### My takeaways from creating Toiletto
(1) I would prioritise product design over development. Toiletto is a frontend heavy project, there is little complexity on the backend. In this context, the product design is the blueprint of the app. Once i had nailed the product design, i was able to cut down the development time by half.

(2) Product design is a form of strategy work. Good product design requires clarity of thought and rigour in thinking. Many developers have a misconception that product design is hard to get wrong. I beg to differ. An intuitive product based on common sense is actually a reflection of good product design. As

(3) There are lots of amazing people out there creating whacky stuff that spark joy. Shout out to Josh Comeau for creating the sparkle effect which was used in Toiletto. Check him out at https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/animated-sparkles-in-react/

### How I think Toiletto can be improved
(1) Improve the code quality of Toiletto by implementing software development principles such as Separation of Concerns.

(2) Improve the file organisation.

(3) Use less React hooks like useEffect. Thereâ€™s definitely a better way to implement business logic than having useEffect everywhere. 

(4) Write test cases. My regression testing for Toiletto was done manually ðŸ’€.

### Special Mention
I would like to give special mention to @greentfrapp, whose advice at the onset paved a much smoother journey in building Toiletto. His three valuable tips were; (1) to work on something that I will enjoy building, (2) use existing tools like Supabase and (3) deploy and share my projects.

And, thank yous to my family and friends for being my user testers!
